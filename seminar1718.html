Let $J(P)$ be the poset of order ideals of $P$. In this talk, we will investigate the periodicity of the Coxeter transformation on the poset $J(P)$, and show that the Coxeter transformation has finite order for two of the three infinite families of cominuscule posets, and the exceptional cases. Our motivation comes from a conjecture by Chapoton which states that the Coxeter transformation has finite order on the poset $J(R)$ when $R$ is the poset of positive roots of a finite root system. Our solution is formulated in representation theory of finite dimensional algebras, and we will further discuss the results within the same context.</div></div>

Its totally nonnegative part is the subset where all Pl�cker coordinates are real and nonnegative. There is a natural action of the cyclic group of order $n$ on $Gr(k,n)$ which preserves its totally nonnegative part. This 'cyclic symmetry' is prominent in the combinatorics of the totally nonnegative Grassmannian. I will discuss some surprising properties of the fixed points of the cyclic action. I will also present joint work with Pavel Galashin and Thomas Lam, which uses the cyclic action to show that the totally nonnegative part of $Gr(k,n)$ is homeomorphic to a ball.</div></div>

Hopkins, McConville, and Propp proved Propp's sorting conjecture. We recast this result in terms of root systems: the labeled chip-firing game can be seen as a �vector-firing� process which allows the moves $\lambda \to \lambda + \alpha$ for $\alpha \in \Phi^+$ whenever $\langle \lambda, \alpha^\vee \rangle = 0$, where $\Phi^+$ is the set of positive roots of a root system of type $A_{2n-1}$. We give conjectures about confluence for this process in the general setting of an arbitrary root system. We show that the process is always confluent from any initial point after modding out by the action of the Weyl group (an analog of unlabeled chip-firing in arbitrary type). We also show that if we instead allow firing when $\langle \lambda, \alpha^\vee \rangle  \in [-k-1,k-1]$ or $[-k,k-1]$, we always get confluence from any initial point. Moreover, in these two settings, the set of weights with given stabilization has a remarkable geometric structure related to permutohedra. This geometric structure leads us to define certain �Ehrhart-like� polynomials that conjecturally have nonnegative integer coefficients.</p><p>This is joint work with Pavel Galashin, Thomas McConville, and Alex Postnikov.</p></div></div>

We will discuss a bit about quiver mutation, and the proceed to exploring quivers for a special sequence of mutations called maximal green sequences. The aim of the talk is to discuss recent work that allows one to build maximal green sequences for larger quivers by looking at "component preserving" sequences on induced subquivers. These new techniques have allowed us to construct maximal green sequences for large families of quivers where their existence was previously unknown.</div></div>

In one variation, it provides a bijection between permutations of $n$ and pairs of standard Young tableaux with the same shape, which is a partition of $n$.  In another (more general) version, it provides a bijection between fillings of a partition $\lambda$ by arbitrary non-negative integers and fillings of the same shape $\lambda$ by non-negative integers which weakly increase along rows and down columns (i.e., reverse plane partitions of shape $\lambda$).  I will discuss an interpretation of RSK in terms of the representation theory of type $A$ quivers (i.e., directed graphs obtained by orienting a path graph). This allows us to generalize RSK to other Dynkin types (plus a choice of minuscule weight), and is related to periodicity results for piecewise-linear toggling.  I will not assume familiarity with either RSK or with quiver representations.  This is joint work with Al Garver and Becky Patrias.</div></div>

Sazdanovic has related $C_G(A)$ to the homology of the "graph configuration space" obtained by taking the cartesian power of $M$ and removing a subset of diagonals encoded by $G$.</p><p>In a recent work with M. Zubkov we investigate whether the commutativity assumption on $A$ may e relaxed to homotopy commutativity. We construct $C_G(A)$ in the case when $A$ is a brace algebra and $G$ is a planar tree. Examples of such $A$ include singular cochain algebras (McClure-Smith), Hochschild cochains of associative algebras (Gerstenhaber-Voronov) and cobar constructions on Hopf algebras (Kadeishvili, Young). We hope that the last class of examples can get us closer to an explicit model for computing invariants of codimension 2 tangles, as provided by the formalism of (stratified) factorization homology.</p></div></div>

Our space is equipped with a standard basis of polyhedral cones called permutohedral cones, studied as plates by A. Ocneanu, consisting of characteristic functions which are labeled by ordered set partitions; these are in duality with faces of the arrangement of reflection hyperplanes $x_i=x_j$.  Motivated in particular by the desire to justify certain shuffle-type relations coming from quantum field theory, we construct a new, canonical basis which is compatible with one or both of two quotients: modding out by characteristic functions of (1) nonpointed cones containing doubly infinite lines, and (2) cones of codimension at least 1.  The important feature here is that subsets of the basis map to bases of the quotients.</div></div>

The $n$-cyclohedron is defined analogously using centrally-symmetric triangulations of a $(2n+2)$-gon, or, modding out by the symmetry, triangulations of an $(n+1)$-gon with one orbifold point. The polytopes can be realized in such a way that their normal fans are the ``$\mathbf{g}$-vector fans," or ``mutation fans," for certain cluster algebras. In this talk I will justify and generalize two relationships which hold between these fans: the normal fan to the $n$-cyclohedron can be obtained by intersecting the normal fan to the $(2n-1)$-associahedron with a certain subspace, and the normal fan to the $n$-cyclohedron refines the normal fan to the $n$-associahedron. I will show that these relationships are instances of ``folding" and ``dominance," respectively, and hold more generally for mutation fans for cluster algebras modeled by surfaces and orbifolds.</div></div>

These affine growth diagrams are in bijection with the $c_{\vec\lambda}$ many components of the polygon space Poly($\vec\lambda$) for $\vec\lambda$ a sequence of minuscule weights and $c_{\vec\lambda}$ the Littlewood-Richardson coefficient. Unlike Fomin growth diagrams, they are infinite periodic on a staircase shape, and each vertex is labeled by a dominant weight of $GL_m$. Letting $m$ go to infinity, a dominant weight can be viewed as a pair of partitions, and we recover the RSK correspondence and Fomin growth diagrams within affine growth diagrams. The main combinatorial tool used in the proofs is the $n$-hive of Knutson-Tao-Woodward. The local growth rule satisfied by the diagrams previously appeared in van Leeuwen's work on Littelmann paths, so our results can be viewed as a geometric interpretation of this combinatorial rule.</div></div>

A-hypergeometric systems are the D-module counterparts of toric ideals, and their behavior is linked closely to the combinatorics of toric varieties. I will discuss recent work that aims to explain the behavior of the solutions of these systems as their parameters vary.

We show that geometrically this corresponds to interpreting higher order poles in the connection as boundary components with bordered cusps (vertices of ideal triangles in the Poincar&eacute metric) on the Riemann surface.  We thus introduce the notion of decorated character variety. This decorated character variety is the quotient of the space of representations of the fundamental groupid of arcs by a product of unipotent Borel subgroups (one per bordered cusp). We demonstrate that this representation space is endowed with a Poisson structure induced by the Fock-Rosly bracket and show that the quotient by unipotent Borel subgroups giving rise to the decorated character variety is a Poisson reduction. We deal with the Poisson bracket and its quantization simultaneously, thus providing a quantisation of the decorated character variety. In the case of dimension 2, we also endow the representation space with explicit Darboux coordinates. We conclude with a conjecture on the extended Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for higher rank algebras (joint work with M. Mazzocco and V. Rubtsov).</div></div>

This extends work of Bertram, Ciocan-Fontanine and Fulton, who provided a way to compute quantum products of Schubert classes of the Grassmannian by applying a combinatorial rimhook rule. Combining our equivariant rule with Knutson and Tao's puzzle rule provides an effective algorithm for computing equivariant quantum Littlewood-Richardson coefficients (polynomials). This rule requires a specialization of torus weights that is tantalizingly similar to maps in affine Schubert calculus.</div></div>

The weak order may be equivalently described using biclosed sets. We study lattices of biclosed sets that generalize the weak order on permutations. We show that any such lattice of biclosed sets is isomorphic to subcategories of the module category of an analogue of the preprojective algebra, which we call torsion shadows. If time permits, we will present a similar description of the shard intersection order of these lattices of biclosed sets. This is joint work with Thomas McConville and Kaveh Mousavand.</div></div>

We give multiple constructions of a Young diagram describing various statistics of the system in terms of familiar objects like birth-and-death chains and Galton-Watson forests. Using these ideas, we establish limit theorems showing that if the first $n$ boxes are occupied independently with probability $p\in(0,1)$, then the number of solitons is of order $n$ for all $p$, and the length of the longest soliton is of order $\log n$  for $p<1/2$, order $\sqrt{n}$ for $p=1/2$, and order $n$ for $p>1/2$. Additionally, we uncover a condensation phenomenon in the supercritical regime: For each fixed $j\geq 1$, the top $j$ soliton lengths have the same order as the longest for $p\leq 1/2$, whereas all but the longest have order at most $\log n$ for $p>1/2$. As an application, we obtain scaling limits for the lengths of the $k^{\text{th}}$ longest increasing and decreasing subsequences in a random stack-sortable permutation of length $n$ in terms of random walks and Brownian excursions.</p><p>This is a joint work with Lionel Levine and John Pike.</p></div></div>

Building on work of Richardson and Springer, a similar combinatorial theory has been developed for involutions in Coxeter groups. Their original motivation comes from the geometry of spherical varieties. We highlight several aspects of this theory, including the enumeration of reduced words for involutions and a natural characterization of the Chinese monoid. We conclude with some remarks on an apparent relationship between type A spherical varieties and the geometry of the orthogonal and Lagrangian Grassmannians. This is joint work with Brendan Pawlowski and Eric Marberg.</div></div>

Subword complexes incarnate several well-known structures: associahedra, finite type cluster complexes, simplices, and even-dimensional cyclic polytopes, for instance. Apart from those, only 1 non-trivial case has been found to be polytopal; this problem requires a deep understanding of reduced expressions in Coxeter groups. In this talk, I will describe three very closely related classical problems on expressions in Coxeter groups that reveal challenging aspects of this open problem.</div></div>

On the other hand, combinatorics of row-standard Young tableaux is also closely related to the affine paving of Springer fibers. In this talk, I briefly recall these concepts and how they are related, and focus on generalizations of this picture to other classical types.</div></div>

Let $A = \{2,6,7\}$, $B = \{1,5,9\}$, $C = \{3,4,8\}$ denote dice taking each of the three indicated values with probability $1/3$. As you can (and should!) check, $A$ dominates $B$ in the sense that when each is rolled  the probability that $A > B$ is greater than $1/2$. Moreover, $B$ dominates $C$, and $C$ dominates $A$, so the dominance relation is non-transitive. To make matters worse, the triple  $A[2]$, $B[2]$, $C[2]$ --- where $A[2]$ denotes the sum of two rolls of $A$, etc. --- is (as you have perhaps already checked) also a nontransitive triple. However, the cyclic dominance order is exactly the reverse of the earlier one. The goal of this talk is to present sets of dice with vastly more peculiar nontransitivity properties.</div></div>
